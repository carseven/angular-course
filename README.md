# Angular practice

The purpose of this repository is to practice frontend development using Angular. \
For this, I have developed the following apps:

- [Gifs App](https://sweet-mochi-8d33b6.netlify.app/)
- [Countries App](https://voluble-semolina-ca7bbf.netlify.app/)
- [Pipes APP](https://ephemeral-rolypoly-f6a63c.netlify.app): Simple project for testing common Angular pipes and Custom Pipes
